To do: 
data preprocessing (split patient and do sliding window) (the paper split, not dilated) DONE
train activity recognition for CNN, DWN, RCNN DONE
fine tune for change point detection DONE
CNN fine tuning should be like wavelet, trainable DONE
multitask of training(indtead of only activity recodgnition, train on activity + detection) 
(CNN, RNN, wavelet/light cpd results) DONE

-------------
lighting the CNN
wavelet, cnn, last trainable or not
-------------


To do:
deploy takes list of time series(for diff. subjects) and give it to non_max_supression
